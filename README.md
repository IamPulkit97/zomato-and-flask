# About the project
This project aims to show the results based on the data that is scraped from the Zomato using Flask and ML.

### Aim
  - In this Project we will take 3 inputs from the user namely Cuisines, Location , Price for one and based on the input provided we have to show Popular Cuisine, Avg       Price for one and most popluar restaurant in that area and then the most popular restaurant that is serving the same Cuisine as you provided
  - Moreover, we need to recommend price and location (based on the input) if the user needs to open a restaurant. For recommendation part ML models were used 

### Prerequisite

  - You would have to install flask (pip install flask) by clicking on the terimal in VS-code and after that you have to install virtual env too by using the same           command (pip install virtualencv)*
